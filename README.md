# GraphingCalculator
This is a graphing calculator python web application. 
The application features a user interface that allows the client to choose between a set of function types.
The user can then enter the corresponding coefficient and constant values for the function and see it graphed on a 
set domain. This program leverages certain Python libraries like MatPlotLib and Flask.

# How to start
In the terminal paste "FLASK_APP=app.py flask run" and hit enter. Then go to the network tab in the upper right corner of Ed 
and select the network to open up the application. You will automatically be directed to a new tab with the Graphinator 
application open.

# How to use
Once the application opens you will see an Html page with several input fields. To start off using the graphing web app you 
must select the type of function you want to be graphed from the drop down. Graphinator features 3 types of functions: linear, quadratic, and 
cubic. Once you select a function type, the Html page will display several other input fields. These fields correspond to the 
coefficient values associated with the different terms for the selected function. For example, if you select the linear 
function type you will see input fields for the slope and the y-intercept. Our application also features a smart scale 
function. The user will be able to select whether they want this feature enabled for the current function they are graphing. If 
selected the function will be graphed on a y-scale that fits the function proportionately. Otherwise, the function will be 
displayed on a preset scale that goes from y = -30 to y = 30. Once all the input fields have been filled out, the user can hit 
the graph function and an image of the function will be generated and displayed on the Html page. To graph other functions, the 
user must follow the previous steps but apply new values to the different input fields.
